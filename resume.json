    "summary": "Having graduated from University with a Music degree I realised that my passion for composition with computer sequencers translated very well to programming and embarked on a journey of learning languages starting with html & css and later on Actionscript, php, SQL and javascript. Over the past 16 years I have continuously challenged myself with new languages, frameworks and methodologies. I have a keen interest in full stack development with Meteor and React as well as Typescript and Polymer as you will see from my Github repos. ",
